## What worked:
```
- After some other methods, it recomended to use a radio for attack selection and it worked greate
- The implamentation of health bars to visualy track the health of the player and enemy.
- A "hint" system that will tell the user what the enemy is about to do, though it is only truthful
70% of the time and lies the other 30%.
```
## What didn't:
```
- There were several instances during development where the game would crash if either the player
or enemy went below 0 health.
- At first the program used buttons to choose the attack but you needed to double click them and it
cause a bunch of bugs.
- Then we moved on to using check boxes, though that caused its own bugs as you could select multiple.
```
## What did you learn:
```
Streamlit is a very useful web based application that I could see myself using in the future, though I
have to learn it myself so that I can better address bugs and the like.
```
