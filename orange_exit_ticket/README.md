## Project Goals:
This is going to be a game I call "Duel", The idea is that it is a Rock-Paper-Scissors type 
game where you are up against an enemy, if you win the enemy takes damage, if the enemy wins you take damage.
The first to zero health loses.

# Setup
```bash
cd orange_exit_ticket
python3 -m venv venv // skip if it's already there
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run Game
```bash
streamlit run duel.py
```

# TODO: install dependencies
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip freeze -r requirements.txt
```
