## Part 1: Initial Understanding

### What I Knew Before Starting
> Before this assignment, my understanding of Streamlit was:
> - I have done some Streamlit in my Python class, but it has been a while and I don't remember much ot it.

### First Impressions
> After reading the assignment and doing initial research:
> - From the last time I vibe-coded, the prompting and iteration seemed to be hit or miss when it comes to functionality, but there were results that worked.
> - Learning a new library can be pretty difficult, espesialy for me.

## Part 2: LLM-Assisted Learning

Document at least 4-5 significant prompts you used. Show iteration where you refined your questions.

### Prompt 1: [Topic - e.g., "Understanding Streamlit's Execution Model"]

**Initial Prompt:**
```
[I'm a Flask developer learning Streamlit. Explain the key differences in how these frameworks work. Specifically: 1. How does Streamlit handle user interactions vs Flask's routes? 2. What happens when a user clicks a button in Streamlit? 3. Why do I need st.session_state when I didn't need anything special for variables in Flask?]
```

**Key Insights from Response:**
> [A lot of it was simmiler to what we learned in class, Flask being a Request/response model and requires HTML knowledge. While Sreamlit is mostly Python providing both its functionality and UI.]

**Follow-up Prompt (if any):**
```
[If you needed clarification or went deeper]
```

**What I Understood After This Exchange:**
> [Summarize your understanding]

---

### Prompt 2: [Topic - e.g., "Session State Basics"]

**Initial Prompt:**
```
[Show me how st.session_state works in Streamlit. I need to:
1. Store whether a user is logged in (boolean)
2. Store the logged-in username (string)
3. Make these persist when the user clicks buttons or interacts with the app Include a minimal example.]
```

**Key Insights from Response:**
> [Session state keys must be initalized first if you intend for them to persist between reruns, ChatGPT also
> recomends using if statments to ensure the key exists before creating them to avoid something called a KeyError.]

**Follow-up Prompt (if any):**
```
[If you needed clarification]
```

**What I Understood After This Exchange:**
> [Summarize]

---

### Prompt 3: [Topic - e.g., "Building the Login Form"]

**Initial Prompt:**
```
[Paste your actual prompt here]
```

**Key Insights from Response:**
> [What did you learn?]

**What Worked vs. What I Had to Modify:**
> [Did the LLM-generated code work immediately? What did you have to change?]

---

### Prompt 4: [Topic - e.g., "Debugging an Issue"]

**The Problem I Was Facing:**
> [Describe what wasn't working]

**Prompt I Used:**
```
[Your prompt asking for help]
```

**Solution/Insight:**
> [What fixed it?]

---

### Prompt 5: [Additional Topic]

**Prompt:**
```
[Your prompt]
```

**What I Learned:**
> [Key takeaway]

---

## Part 3: Challenges and Resolutions

Document at least 2-3 significant challenges you faced.

### Challenge 1: [Brief Title]

**What Happened:**
> [Describe the problem in detail]

**What I Tried That Didn't Work:**
> [List approaches that failed - this is valuable!]
> - Attempt 1: ...
> - Attempt 2: ...

**What Finally Worked:**
> [The solution]

**What I Learned:**
> [The insight you gained]

## Part 4: Flask vs Streamlit Comparison

### Similarities I Noticed
> [What felt familiar coming from Flask?]
> - ...
> - ...

### Key Differences
> [What's fundamentally different?]
> - ...
> - ...

### What Surprised Me Most
> [The thing that was most unexpected]

### When I'd Choose Streamlit Over Flask
> [Based on your experience, when would each be better?]
> - Streamlit is better for: ...
> - Flask is better for: ...

---

## Part 5: Reflection

### What I'd Do Differently Next Time
> [If you started over, what would you change about your approach?]

### Most Valuable Thing I Learned
> [Beyond just Streamlit - what skill or insight was most valuable?]

### Questions I Still Have
> [Anything you're still unclear on?]

### Self-Assessment of Learning Process
> Rate yourself (1-5) on each:
> - Prompt quality/iteration: [ ] / 5
> - Persistence when stuck: [ ] / 5
> - Documentation thoroughness: [ ] / 5
> - Understanding vs. copying: [ ] / 5

## Part 6: Resources Used

### AI Tools
- [Which LLM(s) did you use?]
- [Approximately how many conversations/prompts?]

### Documentation Referenced
- [List any official docs, Stack Overflow, tutorials, etc.]

### Help from Others
- [Did you get help from classmates, instructors, forums? Credit them.]
